 * In ZIO, layers are essentially wrappers around constructors for services in your application.

 * service. Layers can construct many services. In addition, this construction can be resourceful,
 * and even asynchronous or concurrent.
 *
 * Layers bring more power and compositionality to constructors. Although you don't have to use
 * them to benefit from ZIO environment, they can make it easier to assemble applications out of
 * modules without having to do any wiring, and with great support for testability.
